          That and those is a one woman business based in Aarhus - and I see it more
          like a hobby and an appreciation for the craft, rather than a business. I love playing around, especially with glaze combinations.
          That is also the reason why all my products are one of a kind! 
          <p>I donâ€™t stock anything, all I have is what you
          see here. Unless I was procrastinating a photoshoot of my most recent
          works, which to be honest sounds like me.</p>
